<button class="collapsible"> 1. Name two differences between netlify and back4APP, and provide 3 alternatives and competitors to them.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
First difference: The purpose of both sites are completely different in the sense that netlify focuses on hosting static sites for developers that prefer using other static site generators. back4APP purpose is to provide assistance on the backend side of programming, so that programmers do not have to create servers. 
 </p>
  <p>
    Second Difference: Netlify does not have a built in database to assist programmers, it instead forces them to focus to use outside services to store data. Back4APP however provides a database as well as supports other databases to be used without forcing programmers to use outside sources. 
  </p>
<p>
  Competitors: Vercel and Firebase, Heroku
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">2. Briefly compare json, xml, yaml (“ YAML   Ain’t   Markup   Language”), and markdown. </button>

  They all work together cohesively to create an efficient and effective program. JSON and XML interchange and store data. YAML provides an easy syntax to explain the JSON and XML code that was the programmer. Markdown is primarily used to document the program. With these four essential tasks, a program would run effectively and be able to be understood from the outside looking in.  </p>

  <p>First Difference: The learning curve between the two is very different due to Angular having much more features that the average programmer would not be able to pick up upon the first grasp. React tends to cater to the beginner side of programming. </p>
  <p>Second Difference: They use different syntaxes, Angular uses TypeScript while React mainly uses JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Third Difference: React focuses much more on the creation on user interfaces with the use of the premade functions within the library. Angular focuses more on the implementation of the user interfaces in a grander scale of a program and uses features that React is not really capable of.  </p>
  <p>Fourth Difference: React is a JavaScript Library while Angular is JavaScript Framework, this is a major difference because it explains the difference in what the two platforms are capable of doing and providing for a user.  </p>
</div>

  
<button class="collapsible">5.Differentiate nextjs vs. meteorjs vs. expressjs  </button>
